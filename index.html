            Hello! My name is <b>Sally</b>, I am 24 years old and I am what you can call a Software Developer in the making. 
            You know what though, my education up until I took up the <i>Code Fellows Advanced Software Development course
            </i> was mainly in the business field. After Leaving my last job, I noticed this great pull in the market towards 
            technical skills, especially with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. That is when I realized that in order for me 
            to be able to fulfil my goals in life, I need to adjust to the demands of the market. That my friend, is how a 
            Marketing graduate with no previous programming skills has now made the website you are visiting.
