            Hello! My name is <b>Sally</b>, I am 24 years old and I am what you can call a Software Developer in the making. <br>
            You know what though, my education up until I took up the <i>Code Fellows Advanced Software Development course</i> was mainly in the business field; I studies business in high school during my O-levels and A-levels and continued to get a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing after graduating high school. I even worked in the field for close to four years; my last position was an Operations Manager in an apparels company. <br>
            After Leaving my last job, I noticed this great pull in the market towards technical skills, especially with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. That is when I realized that in order for me to be able to fulfil my goals in life, I need to adjust to the demands of the market. That my friend, is how a Marketing graduate with no previous programming skills has now made the website you are visiting. <br><br>
            <big>Just remember, it is never the wrong time to do what is best for you!</big>
